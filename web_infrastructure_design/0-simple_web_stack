Simple Web Stack - One Server Architecture

Overview:
A user wants to access www.foobar.com. Their browser performs a DNS lookup to resolve the domain name to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). The request is sent to a single server, which hosts:
- A web server (Nginx)
- An application server
- Application code
- A MySQL database

Domain Configuration:
- Domain name: foobar.com
- Subdomain: www.foobar.com
- DNS record: 'www' is a subdomain and uses an A record pointing to IP 8.8.8.8

Server Stack Components:
1. **Web Server (Nginx)**:
   - Handles HTTP(S) requests
   - Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
   - Acts as a reverse proxy to forward dynamic requests to the application server

2. **Application Server**:
   - Runs the website’s backend code (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js)
   - Handles business logic and dynamic content generation

3. **Database Server (MySQL)**:
   - Stores persistent data like users, posts, etc.
   - Communicates with the application server using SQL queries

4. **Application Files**:
   - Code base (source code) for handling requests, logic, and database interaction

Communication:
- The user’s browser communicates with the server over HTTP or HTTPS (TCP/IP).
- Internal communication between Nginx, app server, and database happens over the local network (localhost or internal IPs).

DNS:
- The domain 'foobar.com' is configured with a subdomain 'www'
- The DNS record type for www.foobar.com is an **A record** (IPv4 address)
- Resolves www.foobar.com → 8.8.8.8

Potential Issues with This Infrastructure:

1. **SPOF (Single Point of Failure)**:
   - If the one server goes down, the entire website becomes unreachable.

2. **Maintenance Downtime**:
   - Restarting the web or app server for updates or deployments will temporarily make the site unavailable.

3. **Lack of Scalability**:
   - The server cannot handle large amounts of traffic
   - There's no load balancing or replication for high availability

This design is suitable for small websites or testing environments, but not ideal for production systems that require high uptime or scalability.
